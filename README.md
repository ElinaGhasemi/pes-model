# PES-model

This repository contains the source code for PES model, An Energy and Throughput Model for Energy Harvesting IoT Systems. Periodic Energy Har-
vesting Systems (PES) model enables developers to explore energy versus throughput trade-offs early in the design process.

The README briefly describes how to use PES across different IoT benchmarks used to validate PES. The repository includes these files :
- PES_Model.py : Models the energy consumed by an IoT application during different states and predicts the number of shutdowns due to insufficient energy.
- config.py : Contains collection of average harvesting power, wake up and shutdown threshols and system specific energy and power consumption constants.
- Benchmarks.py : Includes IoT benchmarks and their specefic configuration. 
- runme.py :

# Using PES model

For the scripts to work, you must first install:
Python version 3.10.6 or newer

Then, clone pes-model using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/EECS-NTNU/pes-model
```





To run PES model you need to Install
